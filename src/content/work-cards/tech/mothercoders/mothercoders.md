    In early 2019, I worked as the Student Success Coordinator for the inaugural cohort of MotherCoders NYC, a tech nonprofit that gives moms an opportunity to re-enter or level-up in the workplace by introducing them to the tech industry. In my role, I was the on-the-ground contact person between our leadership team, our students, and our partners and guests. I also had the opportunity to lead classes in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and GitHub, and played a major role in assisting our students with their projects.

## Creating a Space Where We Can Build Code, Community, & Confidence

Early in 2019, I had a special opportunity to work for MotherCoders as their Student Success Coordinator for their inaugural cohort in New York City. Before than I had been integrating tech into my multifaceted life by learning to code for a little under a year. As I started stepping away from my online coursework and into the real world, I had been surrounding myself with organizations and people who support women in tech, especially those from non-traditional backgrounds. These spaces I found myself in were so welcoming and so patient with me as I was learning that it inspired me to do the same for my peers. I wasn’t sure of the direction where I wanted to go in tech, but I knew I wanted to give back to the community and create a space where folks can learn openly and freely without fear or shame, where they can grow, connect, and learn to love tech.

This is where MotherCoders came in. They are a tech non-profit that introduces mothers looking to re-enter or level up in the workplace to the industry. Students learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; meet with industry professionals; and code their own websites by the end of the class. MotherCoders was hiring for the role of Student Success Coordinator for their inaugural NYC cohort. The role was so me- a TA role mixed with class coordination- and yet I hesitated, wondering if I was skilled enough in tech to help others learn. Even with most but not all qualifications met (most of my "met" qualifications were in coordination and logistics), I just closed my eyes and hit send.

Three months later, I couldn’t have been more in love with my job. Not only did I get to do all the coordinating and logistical stuff I love to do, I got to share my love for coding with these moms, even leading a few classes myself! I could go on and on about my time with MotherCoders, but the true joy was seeing these AMAZING women grow in ways beyond their tech skills! I saw them connect with each other and saw them thrive. I saw already accomplished, already amazing, already groundbreaking women be vulnerable; hold each other up; call out sexism and agism; speak about motherhood freely without hesitation; take pride in their work; and build confidence. It has been an absolute honor being able to be a part of their journey and I am so blessed they have been a part of mine.

## About MotherCoders

[MotherCoders](https://mothercoders.org) is a non-profit organization that is "growing the tech talent pool by helping women with kids gain the skills, knowledge, and connections they need to thrive in today's digital economy." Through a 9-week program, MotherCoders provides moms looking to either re-enter or level up in the workplace opportunities to learn from and meet with industry professionals, teaching them about the tech industry as well as foundational skills in front-end web development. MotherCoders provides a classroom experience with guest speakers and coaches as well as on-site childcare. MotherCoders also organizes a Field Trip at a tech company, and at the end of the 9-week program, the students take part in Demo Day and share their final projects (a portfolio or other website) to their fellow students, families, friends, MotherCoders leadership team, cohort partners, and many others.

### MotherCoders NYC

In Spring 2019, MotherCoders led their first program in New York City, partnering with Google and [women.nyc](http://women.nyc) (previously through the Office of the Deputy Mayor). Classes were held at locations in the Brooklyn Public Library system. From over 265 applicants, twenty-four students from all over New York City were chosen to participate. These women come from all different backgrounds and hold at least a bachelor's degree and have had previous work experience. They have backgrounds in education, research, marketing, graphic design, project management, IT, linguistics, finance, and more.

Over the course of the program, they learned from experts in design thinking, UX/UI design software engineering, digital marketing, project management, data science, cybersecurity, and more. They also visited SAP in their offices at Hudson Yard and met with a panel of women working in tech. By the end of the program, we graduated our students, with close to 25% receiving job offers before the end of the program. Many of the students continued with their learning and have applied to bootcamps and apprenticeships, internships, returnships in technical roles.

## About the Role

The Student Success Coordinator role was created specifically for the NYC cohort as the leadership team is distributed outside of the NYC area. The Student Success Coordinator served as the on-the-ground coordinator for the program: organizing classes with guests, childcare, and other aspects including lunch and media visits. The Student Success Coordinator's main role, however, was to provide support to our Course Manager and students with their coursework and projects but also provide encouragement and inspiration along the way.

### Student Success

A large part of ensuring student success was creating the right environment for our moms to thrive. This meant **setting the stage** (connecting with our vendors and contacting library branch managers if needed; arriving early to set-up and leaving late to clean-up; organizing childcare; etc.) and **having the right attitude** (being patient and willing to help; providing positive and constructive feedback; helping in-class and outside the classroom; keeping calm in certain situations). I really aimed to make the learning experience a delightful one for our students. Here are a few examples of how I ensured student success:

- **In-class support:**

I supported our Course Manager and students with their coursework as a TA but I also had a few opportunities to lead a few coding lessons! While following online tutorials was part of the curriculum, I saw the need and desire for in-class teaching. What was especially helpful was seeing how all the moving parts come together and I showed that frequently.

For example, when teaching JavaScript, their online tutorials taught the fundamentals while I showed how fundamentals can be applied to their websites, using JavaScript functions to manipulate the DOM. 

I also introduced them to fun games that helped up their CSS skills. I also led them in setting up their development environments and also helped them setup Git and GitHub and showed them a proper Git flow. I assisted them individually with projects and showed them how to debug, troubleshoot, and validate their code.

### * What Students are Saying

"Jessica’s teaching approach was refreshing, it was such a pleasure coming in every Saturday to an energetic mindset. When learning technical concepts, it’s very helpful to have someone explain in non-technical terms. In addition, she went above and beyond in providing supportive resources to ensure the learning modules were grasped. She took time to develop a relationship with her students, which built trust. That allowed me to approach her any time I had questions or needed help. Jessica has a very professional and empathetic demeanor a perfect combination for any opportunity she is given." - Erica Ramirez, Student at MotherCoders NYC Spring 2019

- **Support outside the classroom:**

One of the biggest things that I did for my students was provide two weekly emails. The first was an email that introduced the class of the week: introducing any guest speakers or coaches; reminding them to complete their homework; sharing information from our childcare providers; lunch for the week; and any travel advisories.

The second was a midweek email with any important class announcements and dates but also a weekly resources roundup. Any resources mentioned by guests, shared in class, shared in Slack, or that I found useful for the week's lessons was included in the email. Students really looked forward to these weekly emails.

Another feature of my emails were the tone it set. I often include fun GIFs to help bring a smile on students' faces and I include a segment called **take a < br >**, which encouraged students to take a moment to pause and step away from their learning and projects every once in a while.

I was also available for homework and project help. In particular, for Demo Day, we chose four students to present their projects, and in preparation, I offered to help them with their presentations. I listened to their presentation and offered feedback to make their presentations more impactful and personal. For example, one of our students Shiela created a tool that helped in her classroom so I encouraged her to mention that in her presentation.

### * What Students are Saying

"Honest, helpful, collaborative, problem solver--these are just a few of the traits I would use to describe Jessica, my Student Success Coordinator at MotherCoders. Not only did she help me find ways to solve coding challenges on my own, but she would always go above and beyond in ensuring that we were successful in learning HTML/CSS/JavaScript. She did this by curating a list of helpful websites, videos, books, game-like exercises, and coding challenges to help us learn the material. She is well-versed in programming and trouble shooting code. Jessica is patient and articulates concepts well. She also provides excellent feedback for presentations. You would be lucky if you were able to recruit Jessica on your team! An excellent addition indeed!" - Shiela Lee, Student at MotherCoders NYC Spring 2019

### Team Collaboration & Communication

As the on-the-ground coordinator for a distributed team, leadership depended on me to make sure that the program was running smoothly. If logistical challenges arise, I would do my best to communicate with my team, but more often, I would handle the situation head-on.  All-in-all I was not afraid to step up to the occasion, if need be.

Our team would often have weekly conference calls. To keep the leadership team updated with certain aspects of the program, I created the "Master List," a shared spreadsheet workbook that included information including a one-page program summary, student summary and attendance roster, children summary and roster, guest speakers information, lunch orders and budget, supplies list, and more. We also included evaluation in the workbook. The workbook was a great way to keep track of all aspects of the program and could be easily accessed by the team.

### * What Students are Saying

"Jessica is a wonderful and thoughtful teacher, her approach to teaching web development is comprehensive and direct. She cares about whether or not students fully grasp concepts and she takes the time to help not only in class but also one on one. She is easy to talk to and can be approached with any question or problem. Jessica believes in her students potential especially during topics that are rigorous to learn. Although our program is over Jessica is still checking in on our development and is vocal about our continued success." - Flor Marshall, Student at MotherCoders NYC Spring 2019

## Challenges

As with any pilot program, there were a few challenges present. I had anticipated any possible challenges as I took on the role, having had experiences with organizations and programs in their early stages. This kept me on my toes and ready to act as a liaison between multiple parties including a remote leadership team and local partners. Not only was this a new location for MotherCoders but this was also one of the largest cohort sizes that the organization had. With this in mind, our team had to be adaptable and evaluation was critical. My role required viewing the program as a whole from the perspective of many stakeholders with our students being at the forefront. My role was not only about ensuring the success of our students but also the success of the program.

## In Summary

MotherCoders was an incredible experience to be a part of and I was glad that I was able to make an impact on these women's lives. It gave me the opportunity to work with all my talents from project coordination to coding and even help me become better at both. It was a joy to witness these women and this organization grow.
