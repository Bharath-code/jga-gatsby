Worked on a yearlong project creating an event guide for three major programs of the Dominican Youth Movement USA - the Youth Preaching Workshops, the National College Preaching in Action Conference, and the Dominican High School Preaching Conference. The comprehensive guide included details on all aspects of event planning including topics on venues, vendors, presenters, programming, recruitment, budget, sponsorship, and evaluation. In addition, organized and ran a Youth Preaching Workshop for ten high school students; managed a team of four volunteers to assist with running the National College Preaching in Action Conference; and assisted with running the Dominican High School Preaching Conference.
