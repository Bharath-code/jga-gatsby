    Since 2014, I have taught workshops at the National College “Preaching in Action” Conference, a project of Dominican Youth Movement USA. I introduced students to sacred and liturgical dance while also prepared them for presenting at the Commissioning Liturgy the following day. Each dance I've led is unique- some choreographed by myself, others inspired by their own creative movement, some using props, and some where we encouraged the congregation to follow. The dance seen here was performed in 2018, with music sung by the conference choir.
