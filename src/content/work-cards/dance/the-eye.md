description: |
    "Many Yet One" is a modern proclamation of the Scripture passage found in 1 Corinthians 12. The Scripture passage is recited in the styling of spoken word poetry while the dance includes elements of breaking and hip hop. It has been performed for many events including New York Catholic Youth Day and is a favorite amongst youthful crowds!
