    The Archdiocesan Dance TroupeÂ is a collective of youth and young adult dance groups from across the Archdiocese of New York. They have danced at New York Catholic Youth Day in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Jessica Abejar coordinates the Troupe by inviting groups who would like to perform. Each group choreographs a short section of the dance, with a large group ending and/or beginning section choreographed by Jessica Abejar.
