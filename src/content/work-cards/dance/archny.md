    The Archdiocesan Dance TroupeÂ is a collective of youth and young adult dance groups from across the Archdiocese of New York. We have danced at New York Catholic Youth Day in 2014, 2015, and 2016. I coordinated the Troupe by inviting groups who were interested in performing, by organizing rehearsals for the main event, and by creating a main narrative for the dance. Each group choreographs their own short section of the dance piece and joins in a large group ending and/or beginning section choreographed by myself. Shown here is their first presentation in 2014.
