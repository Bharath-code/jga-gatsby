    Regular reviews of dance shows throughout New York City, featuring reviews of major dance companies, dance festivals, and emerging artists

I allow those unfamiliar with the dance world to get a peek into this multifaceted field by getting right to the heart of each piece. I use colorful language and non-dance terms to capture these dances in the moment as if readers were right in the audience. I especially love writing for emerging artists and dance festivals with very little exposure, helping to not only expand their audience but the field of dance itself.
