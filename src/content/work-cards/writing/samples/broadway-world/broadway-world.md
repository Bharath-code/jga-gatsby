    Regular reviews of dance shows throughout New York City, featuring major dance companies, dance festivals, and emerging artists

By getting right to the heart of each piece, I allow those unfamiliar with the dance world to get a peek into this multifaceted field. I use colorful language and non-dance terms to capture the artistry, athleticism, and emotion of these dances in the moment, as if readers were right there in the audience. I especially love writing for emerging artists and dance festivals with very little exposure, helping to not only expand these artists' reach but also expanding the field of dance itself.
