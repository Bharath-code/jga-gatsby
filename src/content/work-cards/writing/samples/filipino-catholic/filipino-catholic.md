    A monthly youth column focusing on topics such as family, prayer, and the Filipino-American Catholic experience
---
This monthly column was intended for younger readers to connect with their Filipino and Catholic heritage but has been enjoyed by readers of all ages. In simple, easy-to-understand articles, I include topics such as themed prayer ideas; saint profiles; Filipino Catholic customs, traditions, and values; and feast days, holidays and holy days. Occasionally, I also cover local events in the Filipino-American Catholic community.
