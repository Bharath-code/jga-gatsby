A love for movement and a change in lifestyle led me to wellness. After realizing the importance of physical wellbeing along with mental and spiritual wellbeing, I began to pursue a path in wellness becoming a Group Fitness Instructor and later becoming certified in Personal Training through the American Council on Exercise. I became certified in teaching POP Pilates, the very format that got me into fitness. I have taught for various gyms, studios, and community-based organizations including 24 Hour Fitness, The Fit NYC, Jazzercise Huntington, CNYC Fit, and Boutique Fitness.
