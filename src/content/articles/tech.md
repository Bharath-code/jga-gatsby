I recently rediscovered my love for tech and became interested in front-end web design and development. While I was unsure of what exactly I wanted to do or what field to work in, I knew I wanted to give back. My first role in the tech industry was at MotherCoders NYC, where I worked as a Student Success Coordinator. As someone early in their career with various other skills, I was able to help create an environment in which mothers looking to re-enter or level-up in the workplace can get a first-hand look at the tech industry and learn foundational front-end web development skills. I balanced managing the logistics of the program and coaching and even leading a few lessons on front-end languages including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I am looking to continue to make an impact in tech, either by supporting underrepresented people in their learning journeys or by working as a creative designer/developer helping to enable the dreams of others while making the web more accessible and inclusive. As a front-end developer, I am especially interested in web accessibility and design systems.
