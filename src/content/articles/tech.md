I recently rediscovered my love for tech, especially **front-end web design and development**. While I was unsure of what exactly I wanted to do within the field, I knew I wanted to give back to the community. My first role in the tech industry was at **MotherCoders NYC**, where I worked as a Student Success Coordinator. I am looking to continue to make an impact in tech, either by supporting underrepresented people in their learning journeys or by working as a creative designer/developer helping to enable the dreams of others while making the web more accessible and inclusive. As a front-end developer, I am especially interested in **web accessibility**, **design systems**, and **technical writing**.
