Writing has been one of my earliest passions in life, shaping the artist and storyteller I am today. Through writing, I aim to tell untold stories, illustrate different perspectives, educate anyone about anything, and most importantly, connect with people.

Throughout my academic career I had received many **writing awards** in poetry, playwriting, speech writing, and research writing. During my college career, I worked as a writing tutor and interned as an Editorial Intern for **UniPro - Pilipino American Unity for Progress**, fact-checking, editing, and co-authoring policy memos across a vast range of topics ahead of the 2010 presidential election. In recent years, I have written dance reviews in **BroadwayWorld** for shows throughout the New York City area and currently author a youth column for **The Filipino Catholic**, a monthly newspaper for the Filipino-American Catholic community.
