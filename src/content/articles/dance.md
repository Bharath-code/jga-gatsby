Dance has always been an integral part of my life, allowing me to fulfill some lifelong dreams. I've trained in various styles of dance from ballet to hip hop, Filipino folk dance to modern and contemporary dance. I began choreographing and performing since a young age and have been privileged to share my gift and love for dance across the world.

I have worked in various roles in the field and have previously worked at Alvin Ailey Dance Foundation as an arts administrator, BroadwayWorld.com  as a dance writer, and Disney Cruise Lines as a performer before starting my own sacred dance company The Moving Prayer. I was also chosen as one of nine emerging leaders in the U.S. dance field to participate in Dance/USA's Institute of Leadership Training; I was mentored by American sacred dance pioneer Carla de Sola.
